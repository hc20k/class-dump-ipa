# class-dump-ipa
Uses Python 3

Dumps the headers for any decrypted IPA and its frameworks.
This is a tool I made a long time ago, open sourced because why not.

Example usage: `./class-dump-ipa [-h] [-o] Instagram.ipa output_header_path/`

## Changelog

### Version 1.1
- Complete rewrite
- Added ability to open app folder in Finder when dumping is finished.


## REQUIRES class-dump (https://github.com/nygard/class-dump) to be installed.
